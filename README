The Adventurer

The Adventurer is a new character with a variety of different abilities - notably Fish and Foil cards.
The mod features a full set of 75 cards, as well as custom character-specific relics and potions.

I've been working on this mod for over two years, and I'm proud to finally release it to the community!

Keywords

Fish: 0 cost Colorless cards with bonus effects that draw a card when played. Created by certain cards and abilities.

Voyaged: A bonus effect that triggers if you drew the card this turn outside of your opening hand.

Solo: A bonus effect that triggers if the card is the only one in your hand.

Quest: When you complete a Quest, gain its Reward. If you already have that Quest, you draw a card instead of starting it.

Foil: Each card reward while playing as the Adventurer will contain a shiny Foil card! Being Foil does nothing by itself, but some cards interact with the Foil cards in your deck.


Thanks for playing! I hope you have fun.
